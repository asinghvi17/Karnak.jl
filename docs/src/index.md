# Introduction to Karnak

Karnak.jl is a small extension for the Luxor.jl package to
help with drawing some graph-style diagrams.

Karnak relies Graphs.jl for graph construction, and
NetworkLayout.jl for graph layout.

The focus here, unlike other graph visualization packaegs,
is more on decorative and aesthetic uses.

	the following Julia packages, rather than this one.
